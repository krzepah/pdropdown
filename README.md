# preact-dropdown

A dropdown component written with preact.

Cool thing here is that the dropdown will "deactivate" when clicked outside of it.
Package works by specifying an ID which will be checked on 'click' event.

Important thing to know may be that a click event is registered for every DropDown instance.
